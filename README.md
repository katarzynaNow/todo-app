This repository is for an example application built within my Java – Spring Framework online course.

The application was used to learn how to: 
- build project using the Spring Boot application starter, go through the first working version 
- convert Rest Repository  to @RestController
- configure, use properties files, YAML and various profiles
-	connect to a relational database H2 and create database migrations using Flyway
-	use the Hibernate and Spring Data frameworks in the contex of object-relational mapping
-	make use of dependency injection
-	create tests using tools: JUnit5, Mockito, AssertJ
